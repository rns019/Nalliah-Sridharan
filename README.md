Linux Debugging examples.

A debugger plays a vital role in any software development system. Nobody can write a bug-free code all at once. During the course of development, bugs are being raised and needs to be solved for further enhancement. A development system is incomplete without a debugger. Considering the open source developers community, GNU Debugger is their best choice. It is also used for commercial software development on UNIX type platforms.
GNU Debugger, also known as gdb, allows us to sneak through the code while it executes or what a program was trying to do at the moment before it crashed. GDB basically helps us to do four main things to catch flaws in the source code.

1)Start the program, specifying arguments that may affect the general behavior.

2)Stop the program on specified conditions.

3)Examine the crash or when program was stopped.

4)Change the code and to experiment with the modified code instantaneously.

Debugging can be done either by line number or function name or memmory address.
